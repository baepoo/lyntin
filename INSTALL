Summary
=======

This document holds installation instructions for various operating
systems as well as a series of general setup instructions for getting
started with Lyntin.

There are separate instructions for Unix/Linux and for Windows.  Read
the appropriate one for your system.


Easy-install
============

Requirements
------------

1. Python 2.3
2. setuptools (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools)

Steps
-----

Run::

   easy_install lyntin


Lyntin takes both command-line options as well as a config file.  A 
sample config file looks like this::

   [Lyntin]
   ui:        text
   datadir:   /home/willg/ltd40
   moduledir: /home/willg/ltd40
   readfile:  http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/3krc


To start Lyntin with the config file do this::

   runlyntin -c /path/to/config.ini

Lyntin takes a series of command-line options.  For a list of basic 
options and explanations, run::

   runlyntin --help



Unix/Linux
