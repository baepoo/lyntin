This directory will contain a series of scripts and other helper 
tools that can be used for Lyntin development and use.  Nothing
in this directory is even remotely supported.

Contents:

testserver.py
    Neil's Pub is a small mini-mud capable of allowing multiple
    people to log on and do basic things.  It allows us to test
    various things without connecting to a real mud and possibly
    messing things up.  It's also another reason why Lyntin is
    so cool--you get your own mini-mud along with your mud 
    client!

unittest.py
    Unit tests for the standalone functions in lyntin.utils.
